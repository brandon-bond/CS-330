How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

My approach to designing software is by a checklist, I like to have a step by step insturction to what needs to be done. This makes me work
more efficiently and have a better understanding of what I need to do, it also provides a timeline of the project. The project that we
worked on helped me build skills for organizing, reading, and changing code to fit the scenario that I am trying to make. The design
process that I applied to my project was to make areas of the 2D scene into the 3D scene by breaking it into multiple shapes that were
available to me. The later in the project the better I was getting using OpenGL and there are some things that I would do differently if I
were to restart. I would break the major design down into more shapes allowing for some depth to be created as you cannot create negative
space in parts of a shape. This would be the biggest tactic change for the approach to the project and will change my thinking for future
work.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

The new development stratagies when working on the 3D scene compared to my prevous work was to incrementally change the code and run it to
test if the changes had translated to the scene properly. This was different for me because I am used to finishing a complete task then
making changes to fix any issues then moving on to the next task. Ther was a lot of iteration when working on the 3D the objects needed to
be shaped individually and moved individually, this required me to make a change and then run the project to see how the scene changed.
There was a learning curve in the first few milestones but then I got better at making changes and understanding what they were going to
do befor running the scene. My approach changed while learning, and I found that it was better to stay organized, comment where each shape
went in the scene, and what changes needed to be made in the code for the objects to work. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science has always been a dream to me, the developing side of computer science has drawn me in the most. My dream would to be able
to work on a video game that has a lot of impact on people, I want to be able to create something for someone that helps them mentaly, or
they can use as an outlet in there lives. Computer science will help me achieve that goal, if not in game development then in a programming
position that people can rely on to make their lives easier. Computational graphics and visualizations gives me skills that can be used in
all sorts of development cources in my educational carreer and professional career. The skills that will help me that I learned in this class
are skills in testing, organization, understanding what code does, and most importantly the ability to learn something new with C++.
